  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt; 
       &lt;br&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;
        A lovely, warm late autumn day was the starting point for our trip to Cannes. Cannes - well known for its glamorous and celebrity packed film festival - shows his french “charme” especially in the off-season, when the tourists swarms are draining and the french li. 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;
        Start with a visit to the local market (Foreville), followed by an excellent lunch at famous sea-food restaurant “Brun Astoux”, which will make your day. 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt; 
       &lt;br&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;
        There is nothing quite like a French market with its colours, smells, sounds and hustle and bustle - especially in the south of France where the sensory delights are heightened several fold. 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt; 
       &lt;br&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;
        Forville market can be reached by walking up the rue Gazagnaire, nearly opposite the bus station. There is also one hour free parking at the Forville car park. In the market you will find flowers, fish, fruit and vegetables as well as dairy products, spices, chickens and ducks&amp;hellip;the list goes on. All around the market proper are lots of shops from a great hardware store to a shop specialising in smoked fish and another in live crustaceans. There is also a good wine and champagne outlet where you can sit and eat oysters or a snack with a glass of wine or two. Bistros and bars abound, by the way. Leader Price has a small supermarket on the corner. 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt;
        The market is open 7am till 1pm every day except Mondays. Pedestrianised area. 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt; 
       &lt;br&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
      &lt;div&gt; 
       &lt;br&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content>
